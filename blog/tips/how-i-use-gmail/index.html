            <h3 class="blog-post-title">How I use GMail</h3>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">Post on Saturday, February 22nd 2014</p>
            <p>Communication is one key component to succeeding as a comany.  For me, that means email and other communication mediums are critical to <a href="https://viaforensics.com">viaForensics</a> success.</p>
<h2 id="my-unstructured-database">My unstructured database</h2>
<p>Years ago, when I was still on Outlook and Exchange, I abandoned folders and kept everything in my Inbox.  While the Microsoft search add-on was not great, it did a decent job.  I reazlied that all the time I had spent organizing emails into folders was better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>About a year ago, we switched to GMail.  The first week was hard but after that, I could not imagine switching back.  </p>
<p>Search is king and I&#39;ve not found any other solution that does it better than GMail (ok, I only tried Outlook so ymmv).  So, I use email as my unstructred database.  I let data flow in, Google indexes it and at any point in time I can quickly recall that crucial converstaion.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve not learned some of the <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en">advanced search keywords</a> (like from:some@email.com or has:attachment), it&#39;s worth every minute to do so.</p>
<h2 id="shortcut-keys">Shortcut keys</h2>
<p>If you have not enabled <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?hl=en">GMail shortcut keys</a>, stop and do it now ([Settings -&gt; General] (<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/general">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/general</a>) -&gt; Keyboard shortcuts).  It&#39;s a <em>huge</em> time saver.  You can tear through email quickly.  Some of my daily ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li>e - archive</li>
<li>j - next</li>
<li>r - reply</li>
<li>a - reply to all</li>
<li>3 - delete</li>
</ul>
<p>While you are in the settings screen, I recommend enabling &quot;Auto-advance&quot; as well.  This means you can read an email, reply, archive and automatically moved to the next email without ever leaving the keyboard.</p>
<h2 id="drowning-in-emails">Drowning in emails</h2>
<p>As viaForensics has grown, so has my email volume (several 100 a day now).  My previous technique was to keep any email I needed to follow up with unread.  This obviosuly did scale.</p>
<p>I stumbled across an article by Andreas Klinger entitled, <a href="http://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more">&quot;Don&#39;t drown in email!  How to use GMail more effectively&quot;</a> and drank the Kool-Aide (mostly).   </p>
<p>I now quickly rip through emails, archiving nearly all of them.  GMail search is fantastic so I can always find an email I need.  If an email takes me more than minute to respond, I flag as Important (yellow-star) and move on.  I can then revisit that list daily to make sure I take the time to deal with critical communication.</p>
<p>I also find that I often want to make sure something I delegated is completed.  So, I use the orange double arrow to track those.</p>
<p>And I threw in one of my own.  I often send or receive pictures of my children and want to be able to quickly see them.  So I have a special star setup for them.</p>
<p>The one thing I was not able to do was archive all 70k+ emails.  I have a legacy of about 1,700 unread emails that were important at some point and I can&#39;t bring myself to archive them.  So, I&#39;m slowly working my way back through them.</p>
<p>Hope some of the techniques I use are using for manaing your likely growing volume of email.</p>
