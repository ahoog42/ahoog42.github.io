 * [Continuous forensic monitoring](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2012103236A1)

and wrote two books on mobile forensics and security :

 * [Android Forensics](http://www.amazon.com/Android-Forensics-Investigation-Analysis-Security/dp/1597496510/)  (available in 4 langauges)
 * [iPhone and iOS Forensics](http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-iOS-Forensics-Investigation-Analysis/dp/1597496596/)

When not breaking (or fixing) things, I enjoy good wine, science fiction, running and tinkering with geeky gadgets.
