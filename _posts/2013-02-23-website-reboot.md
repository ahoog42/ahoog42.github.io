title: Website reboot

My website has annoyed me for years.  I've built custom sites, used wordpress, and many others I've simply forgotten.  My first webpage ever was coded for an independent study during college.  For years, my site simply said:

`note to self: use drop database with extreme caution`

I read a lot (online) and have much I'd like to share.  So I'm excited to finally bring my website back online.  I host using GitHub Pages and look forward to sharing things again.
