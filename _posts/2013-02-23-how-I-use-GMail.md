title: How I use GMail
---

Communication is one key component to succeeding as a comany.  For me, that means email and other communication mediums are critical to [viaForensics](https://viaforensics.com) success.

## My unstructured database
Years ago, when I was still on Outlook and Exchange, I abandoned folders and kept everything in my Inbox.  While the Microsoft search add-on was not great, it did a decent job.  I reazlied that all the time I had spent organizing emails into folders was better spent elsewhere.

About a year ago, we switched to GMail.  The first week was hard but after that, I could not imagine switching back.  

Search is king and I've not found any other solution that does it better than GMail (ok, I only tried Outlook so ymmv).  So, I use email as my unstructred database.  I let data flow in, Google indexes it and at any point in time I can quickly recall that crucial converstaion.

If you've not learned some of the [advanced search keywords](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en) (like from:some@email.com or has:attachment), it's worth every minute to do so.

## Shortcut keys
If you have not enabled [GMail shortcut keys](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?hl=en), stop and do it now ([Settings -> General] (https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/general) -> Keyboard shortcuts).  It's a *huge* time saver.  You can tear through email quickly.  Some of my daily ones include:

* e - archive
* j - next
* r - reply
* a - reply to all
* 3 - delete

While you are in the settings screen, I recommend enabling "Auto-advance" as well.  This means you can read an email, reply, archive and automatically moved to the next email without ever leaving the keyboard.

## Drowning in emails
As viaForensics has grown, so has my email volume (several 100 a day now).  My previous technique was to keep any email I needed to follow up with unread.  This obviosuly did scale.

I stumbled across an article by Andreas Klinger entitled, ["Don't drown in email!  How to use GMail more effectively"](http://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more) and drank the Kool-Aide (mostly).   

I now quickly rip through emails, archiving nearly all of them.  GMail search is fantastic so I can always find an email I need.  If an email takes me more than minute to respond, I flag as Important (yellow-star) and move on.  I can then revisit that list daily to make sure I take the time to deal with critical communication.

I also find that I often want to make sure something I delegated is completed.  So, I use the orange double arrow to track those.

And I threw in one of my own.  I often send or receive pictures of my children and want to be able to quickly see them.  So I have a special star setup for them.

The one thing I was not able to do was archive all 70k+ emails.  I have a legacy of about 1,700 unread emails that were important at some point and I can't bring myself to archive them.  So, I'm slowly working my way back through them.

Hope some of the techniques I use are using for manaing your likely growing volume of email.
